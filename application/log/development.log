AbstractController::ActionNotFound (The create action could not be found for the :authenticate_user!
callback on PostsController, but it is listed in the controller's

Raising for missing callback actions is a new default in Rails 7.1, if you'd
like to turn this off you can delete the option from the environment configurations
or set `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions` to `false`.
